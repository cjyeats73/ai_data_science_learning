# ai_data_science_learning

## Overview
This repository is a learning assignment where I attempted to recreate an example notebook by prompting a large learning AI to create code snippets for me. 

This notebook evaluates card transaction data. It does some basic exploratory data analysis and uses some basic machine learning models to predict card fraud.
